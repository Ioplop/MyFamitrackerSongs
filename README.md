# Ioplop's Famitracker songs

## About these chiptunes
Most of these are just ideas that I wanted to test out and see if they lead anywhere. Most also don't.

## Instructions
To open these, you'll need [Dn-famitracker](https://github.com/Dn-Programming-Core-Management/Dn-FamiTracker), which has been my chiptune tool of choice after [Famitracker](http://www.famitracker.com/)'s death.

## Tune descriptions

Below is the list of all my chiptunes, with their current status and a brief description of what they are.

### BrokenTime [Unfinished]

A pathetic attempt at making a very simple track for a minimalistic pixel art game or something. 

The idea was to have an inconsistent meter through the song.

I didn't finish it because I'm a sleepy snail.

### Fake end [Mistake]

An attempt at making a more plausible cover of [Fake End](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/583118) that obviously didn't work and I probably shouldn't have even tried, but here we are.

### Fail01 [Failure]

An attempt at failing at failing. I failed.

### Experimenting [Evolved into Destination 01]

Just an idea that I had in mind. I made this to better think of the melody, and ended up making another chiptune called Destination 01.

### Destination 01 [WIP]

Rather than just a song, this is intended to be an intro for a game about robots trying to find humans in space, with pixel art slides and text at the bottom. The game was almost finished for RobotDay2024 on Newgrounds.

It could use a lot of work on the percussions, hopefully with an added DPCM track.

Probably the most intresting thing I have on this repo.

### C-Test01 [Existing]

A thing without direction that leads nowhere really but is okay.

### hypersnail [Unfinished]

This is what happens when the snails extend their tentacles out of their shell.

### KatheStar [Finished?]

This is literally Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I was trying to show the program to Katherinne and she took command of the percussion in the second frame. She did something.

### MPeS [WIP]

My current project. This is a cover of [Material particulado en suspensión](https://open.spotify.com/track/1HQQ9fvTNmgXAkgHvmAJRK?si=85f5c50c30b8467d) by Nando García. The cover is still very much a work in progress but it should get updated consistently for some time.

### SkySnail [Should be dead]

Honestly I should 100% delete this from the repo... but I'll leave it there for a while.

Anyways, this is a cover of [Gaboicé!](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/568661).

### Storms

This file contains multiple songs:

**Storms - A [Finished]** 

I really don't wanna comment on how this came to be. Suffice to say, it was not a worthy reason.

But I do like the outcome a bit, and it's uploaded [here](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1234146).

**Storms - B [Finished]**

A very simple concept  based on Storms - A meant for, like, a shop or lobby or something.

**Silent Storm [Unfinished]**

What happens to the song when it gets so depressed it doesn't even wanna be finished.

### Breezes [WIP]

It's like Storms but calmer and unfinished.

### Volveremos a Hablar - Deuman [Unfinished]

I was trying to annoy my programming teacher for the laughs and the fun of it. I made this cover of [one of his songs](https://youtu.be/5pSkVVcWTa4), but didn't finish it because I'm snaily and stuff.

### WIP [WIP]
It's a work in progress...

Which was abandoned...

Honestly I should delete it but it's here for the memes.
